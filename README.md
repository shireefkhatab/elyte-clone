2- FUNCTIONALITY

	# NAVIGATION & FOOTER:
		* Contacts : Tel, Email, Social media links And other links
		* Company + submenu: Replace it with just About us link.
	
	# CONTACT US PAGE:
		* Map: Serve over HTTPS.
			please note: no map on github site because google map was served over http and Github site accepts only https service. once the site is hosted it will work in shaa Allah .

		* Contact Form: Better to be submitted with some backend code for action and validation.
	# Add server code for testimomnial and patrtners to be dynamics.	

3- CONTENT

	# ALL PAGES: 
		* Update Our Technology Partner; 
		* Update Client Testimonials;
	# HOME PAGE:
		* Content: Needs more content to be more engaging (Summury of all pages of the site).


4- PERFORMANCE
	
	Navigation: 
		* Implement Angular SPA using ui-router for Fast and smooth routing between pages.
	Loading time: 
		* Use build system to concat and minify styles and scripts.
			(for now: gulp, then: will migrate to webpack or Rollup).
		* Reduce the amount of vendor code which not needed in the production phase.

In shaa Allah once we agree on the new updates i'll start implementing them as much and quick i can.
