	# In the future in shaa Allah, A portfolio page with live projects must be added!

4- PERFORMANCE
	
	Navigation: 
		* Implement Angular SPA using ui-router for Fast and smooth routing between pages.
	Loading time: 
		* Use build system to concat and minify styles and scripts.
			(for now: gulp, then: will migrate to webpack or Rollup).
		* Reduce the amount of vendor code which not needed in the production phase.
	SEO (Ranking the site high on search engines): I know little about SEO, Recently Started to look into it, or Hassan can help more in shaa Allah.
In shaa Allah once we agree on the new updates i'll start implementing them as much and quick i can.
